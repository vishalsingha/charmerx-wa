### Guide for dating
The main purpose of a conversation on Hinge is to eventually set up a date. While not every conversation will lead to a date (someone says something that turns the other person off, or an incompatibility appears that can't be overcome, time-wasters), the most common issue I see is people chatting endlessly with no clear goal in mind. The end goal is simple: a date. That’s it.

Mirroring
One important aspect to keep in mind when texting is mirroring. What is mirroring? Mirroring is adapting your texting style to match the person you’re talking to. For example, if someone writes long, multi-paragraph messages, or 3 or 4 rapid replies, it's okay to respond in kind. If you answer a long reply with one sentence, it can come across as uninterested or dismissive in what they had to say.

On the flip side, if someone only sends short sentences or one-word answers, responding with long paragraphs may seem overwhelming or try-hard.

If your match uses informal "text speak" (emojis, acronyms, abbreviations), it's fine to mirror that style in your responses. Texting back in a very formal style may make you appear unfriendly or frigid.

The point of mirroring is to build rapport with your match, making you seem engaged without coming off as either disinterested or overeager. But be careful not to overdo it either. You still want to be yourself. Once you understand your own conversational style, you'll find the right balance.

Ask Open-Ended Questions
Ask questions that allow the other person to talk about whatever and keep the conversation flowing, instead of something that ends in a yes or no answer. (With the exception of asking someone out on a date, of course.) For example, if your match mentions liking movies, don’t ask, "Did you watch the new movie this weekend?" (which is a closed-ended question). Instead, ask, "What did you think of that new movie? I heard great things about it!"

Also, be flexible. Let the conversation flow naturally. Don’t be stuck in a strict questions and answers format. It’s a conversation, not an interrogation.

Avoid Interview Mode at All Costs
Following up on the previous point, one of the most common traps people fall into is "Interview Mode," where one question follows another without any meaningful follow up on what the other person has said. While asking your match questions to develop rapport is important, you're not there to interview them as if you're looking to hire them for a job. A conversation should be natural, and interview mode tend to be mechanical and sounds more impersonal.

Here’s an example of Interview Mode:

You: "Where did you go during the summer?"

Match: "I went to Paris! I always wanted to see the Eiffel Tower in person! What about you?"

You: "I went to Cancun for my friend's wedding. Do you always travel in the summer?"

Match: "I try to. It's when work is least busy, so I always try to go somewhere."

You: "Cool. What else do you like to do?"

An actual conversation should try to follow up on the answers and isn't just about moving onto the next question. Give a thoughtful answer and follow up on whatever they’ve shared.

You: "Oh wow, I’d love to see the Eiffel Tower someday. The wedding was a blast, and I got to show off my dance skills, although I didn't get to see much of Cancun itself. Anyways, tell me more about Paris! What was the best part?"

A natural conversation should feel like a flow of shared experiences, not just a series of questions.

Relate Your Own Experiences
Not every response needs to be a question. If your match shares something and didn't ask a follow-up question, you can reciprocate by sharing a similar experience.

Match: "I went to Paris this summer! It was so beautiful"

You: "That sounds amazing! I visited Amsterdam last year and it was so amazing. I’d love to hear more about your time in Paris!"

This helps build rapport and keeps the conversation balanced, with the hopes of leading to a date. Remember,a conversation isn't an interview and it’s not all about just asking questions. Share a bit about yourself too.

Be Fun and Tease (With Caution)
If they say something like, "I love coffee from this cafe," you can say, "The best coffee is actually at that place down the street—fight me 😂."

However, there's a catch. Teasing takes skill, practice, and timing. Context is also important. If you’ve built a rapport, teasing can be fun, but if you say it at the wrong moment or in the wrong tone, it could come across as rude or dismissive. You have to know when to be playful and tease, when to throw in a joke, and when to be sincere. Obviously, when your match is texting something serious, it’s not the appropriate moment to tease.

Note: Teasing should never be insulting or mocking. Saying, "Your choice of cafe sucks, their coffee is awful" isn’t teasing, it's being negative and insulting. Teasing is supposed to be lighthearted and fun. You may be able to tease your long time friend with insults, but that's because a familiarity exists and boundary has already been set. It doesn't exist for a stranger.

Strike When the Iron Is Hot
When the conversation is flowing well, and you’re connecting over similar interests or shared experiences, ask them out. “Would you like to meet up for drinks/coffee/ice cream and talk more about (whatever topic you both were discussing)?” Don’t wait too long and drag out a conversation past the natural end point and ask another question (Note: This is assuming you’re had at least a few solid exchanges or you’ve been talking for a couple days minimum depending on the pace of response).

If they’re not ready, they’ll likely let you know. They might say something like, "I’d like to chat more first," or suggest a video or phone call instead. Alternatively, if they’re not interested, it’s better to know sooner rather than later. You’re on a dating app to find a date, not a pen pal.

Don’t Go Off-App Just to Chat More
Do I need to reiterate that the point of Hinge is to go on dates? Often too many of people fail to land a date is because even after building rapport, instead of asking their match to a date, they decide to ask them to go off-app in order to talk more. Stop wasting everyone's time by asking for their Instagram, number, Snapchat, or whatever in order to talk more. While you're busy trying to get their Instagram, someone else a lot smarter will be asking for a date and your messages will now be ignored.

Don’t waste time asking for social media contacts if you haven’t even set up a date yet. The best way to find out if someone is compatible is to date them. No amount of texting is going to compare versus just meeting someone in person, and more texting risks the chances of building up unrealistic expectations and ultimately disappointment when the real person doesn't match their texting personality.

Have Patience
Just because someone takes longer to respond doesn’t necessarily mean they’ve lost interest. People get busy, and sometimes they’re talking to multiple people at once. Sometimes people don’t check the app during weekends, or they may be preoccupied with something else at the moment and a dating app match isn't something they consider important.

Patience is key. Don’t panic if a match don’t respond quickly.

Double Texting Isn’t a Sin
We used to get so many "should I double text?" posts that we essentially stopped allowing them here. There is nothing inherently wrong with a double text if a conversation ran into a lull. Sometimes people will forget to respond, as you are just a stranger on a dating app and therefore lowest on the priority list in a lot of people's lives. Double texting by itself isn't desperate or needy. You may thought of something on the previous text you sent that you forgot, and it's fine to text again. Or to clarify something to avoid a misunderstanding. Or the conversation essentially died out and you want to take a shot at re-engaging.

What is desperate is texting multiple times in rapid succession because a match didn't answer back with things like "did you get my text??", "why aren't you answering me??", "hello??". That is needy, desperate, and unattractive.

Too many people follow these rigid rules of never double texting because they don't want to appear desperate or needy (who exactly is judging you anyways?), which ignores the context of the situation. If a conversation has genuinely died out and you want to reignite it, there is nothing wrong with double texting.

Success Is Never Guaranteed
Sometimes, no matter what you do, the conversation just won’t go anywhere and you have to drop it and let it go. There will always be people on dating apps who are window shopping, seeking validation, or just messing around and not ready to date, or has no intentions to date. There will be boring people. Or they lose interest through no fault of your own and beyond your control. Does it suck? Sure, but that’s the challenge of online dating. You’re gonna run into some duds. But you can’t let that get you down.

Don’t dwell on it or think it’s all your fault. You can do no wrong and still come out on the losing end. The lesson is not letting it get to you, because people aren't doing it out to get you. You never know what's going on in someone else's life after all. Dating is still a numbers game and timing and luck both play a big part.

There Is No One-Size-Fits-All Approach
Finally, remember that no one approach works for everyone. Just because something worked with one person doesn’t mean it will work with another person. People are not a monolith, and there's no magic formula for success.

This is something I have repeated here a lot, particularly with men who often think there is a secret trick to make every woman fall for them, if only they can figure out what that trick is.

And what ends up happening is these guys act too formulaic and robotic because they think this is what a man has to do in order to be successful with women. But that's not how it works - there are no guaranteed formulas, tricks, techniques, or blueprint that will make someone like/date/love/sleep with you.

The best method is, and always has been, be your genuine self.

I hope this guide help, and good luck out there.
